Discussion comparing the top 5 results between the two search engines across all four queries:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The comparison between the top 5 results retrieved using Lucene and our implementation of the Vector Space Model(VSM) are given below: 

Query 1: global warming potential
----------------------------------
Lucene:

1 Q0 Globalwarming(docID393) 1 0.28829005 Lucene
1 Q0 JosephRomm(docID490) 2 0.23419784 Lucene

1 Q0 Energyconsumption(docID262) 5 0.0915709831962 VSM


Comparison:
------------
From the above two tables we can see that the document named 'Globalwarming' is ranked 1 for both the systems and the scores derived using Lucene and VSM differ by a really small margin. Moreover, another document named 'Environmentalimpactoftheenergyindustry' also features in top 5 documents retrieved by both systems. 
The second ranked document -'JosephRomm'- as per Lucene appears in rank 7 as per VSM.
The third ranked document -'UnitedNationsFrameworkConventiononClimateChange'- as per Lucene appears in rank 9 as per VSM.
The fifth ranked document -'Climatechange'- as per Lucene appears in rank 8 as per VSM.
The third ranked document -'Climatechangemitigation'- as per VSM appears in rank 6 as per Lucene.
The firth ranked document -'Energyconsumption'- as per VSM appears in rank 7 as per Lucene.
So, overall for Query1 we can conclude that there is a high overlap among the top retrieved results using our implementation of Vector Space Model and Lucene systems.

The fourth ranked document -'Sustainableenergy'- as per VSM appears in rank 8 as per Lucene.
The firth ranked document -'10025renewableenergy'- as per VSM appears in rank 61 as per Lucene.
The comparison shows that the top results retrieved from both systems overlap in moderation for this query. There are also certain variations in the scores generated by both the retrieval models leading to consequent changes in the rank of the documents. 


Query 3: solar energy california
---------------------------------

Lucene:

3 Q0 NevadaSolarOne(docID591) 1 0.33830875 Lucene
3 Q0 Solarpower(docID813) 2 0.3263637 Lucene
3 Q0 SolarDecathlon(docID807) 3 0.29864913 Lucene
3 Q0 California(docID94) 4 0.2917304 Lucene
3 Q0 SiliconValleyPower(docID798) 5 0.28629193 Lucene

VSM:

3 Q0 California(docID95) 1 0.41837310986 VSM
3 Q0 Solarenergy(docID809) 2 0.377436065419 VSM
3 Q0 Solarpower(docID814) 3 0.325025658256 VSM
3 Q0 RenewableenergyinAsia(docID713) 4 0.280195983963 VSM
3 Q0 NevadaSolarOne(docID592) 5 0.278127074283 VSM


Comparison:
-----------

For the third query, we can see that three documents 'NevadaSolarOne', 'California', 'Solarpower' appears in top 5 for both the retrieval systems.
The document 'NevadaSolarOne' which appears 1st in Lucene rankings is ranked 5th as per VSM systems.
The document 'Solarpower' which appears 2nd in Lucene rankings is ranked 3rd as per VSM systems.
The document 'California' which appears 4th in Lucene rankings is ranked 1st as per VSM systems.
The document 'Solarthermal' which appears 5th in Lucene rankings is ranked 6th as per VSM systems.
However, there are certain variations in the rankings as well.
The document 'SolarDecathlon' which appears 3rd in Lucene rankings is ranked 35th as per VSM systems.
The document 'SiliconValleyPower' which appears 5th in Lucene rankings is ranked 46th as per VSM systems.
The document 'RenewableenergyinAsia' which appears 4th in VSM rankings is ranked 55th as per Lucene systems.
So, even though there are three documents common among the top 5 search results for both the systems, we can see that there are certain skewed rankings. Moreover, the scores between documents retirieved from both systems are also not as consistent as we have seen in case of Query 1. The comparison suggests that the overlap between the search results is somewhat better than what we have got for Query 2 but not as good as the overlap in Query 1.


Query 4: light bulb bulbs alternative alternatives
---------------------------------------------------

Lucene:

4 Q0 Phaseoutofincandescentlightbulbs(docID651) 1 0.629307 Lucene
4 Q0 Incandescentlightbulbs(docID454) 2 0.3953529 Lucene
4 Q0 Incandescentlightbulb(docID453) 3 0.39418444 Lucene
4 Q0 Energysavinglamp(docID290) 4 0.33169496 Lucene
4 Q0 LEDlamp(docID500) 5 0.2289057 Lucene


VSM:

4 Q0 Phaseoutofincandescentlightbulbs(docID652) 1 0.52901273801 VSM
4 Q0 Incandescentlightbulbs(docID455) 2 0.31396018208 VSM
4 Q0 Incandescentlightbulb(docID454) 3 0.312354139484 VSM
4 Q0 LEDlamp(docID501) 4 0.239257334082 VSM
4 Q0 LEDlights(docID502) 5 0.2389445214 VSM

Comparison:
-----------

From the above two tables, we can see that 4 documents match between the top 5 results derived from Lucene and VSM systems. The top three ranked documents -'Phaseoutofincandescentlightbulbs', 'Incandescentlightbulbs', 'Incandescentlightbulb' are also an exact match between the two tables for this query.
The 5th ranked document -- 'LEDlamp' -- in Lucene is 4th ranked for VSM.
The 4th ranked document -- 'Energysavinglamp' -- in Lucene is 6th ranked for VSM.
The 5th ranked document -- 'LEDlights' -- in VSM is 6th ranked for Lucene.
For this query we can say that the top 5 results derived from VSM and Lucene systems are very similar and the scores generated by both systems are also consistent. Among all four queries, this query has the highest degree of overlap between the retrieved results for both the systems.

General Conclusion Statement:
------------------------------

Lucene uses the Boolean model to find matching documents, and a formula called the practical scoring function to calculate relevance. This formula borrows concepts from term frequency/inverse document frequency and the vector space model but adds more-modern features like a coordination factor, field length normalization, and term or query clause boosting. On the other hand, my retrieval model implements only Vector Space Model using term frequency/inverse document frequency as the weights. 

The inconsistencies that cn be found between the results of the two retrieval models in the above comparisons can be accounted for the fact that Lucene also takes into consideration Binary model whereas our retrieval model does not. Let's see the number of hits generated by Lucene for the four queries:

A. Query1 -- global warming potential -- found 665 hits
B. Query2 -- green power renewable energy -- found 908 hits
C. Query3 -- solar energy california -- found 855 hits
D. Query4 -- light bulb bulbs alternative alternatives -- found 530 hits

In Lucene, number of hits determine the number of documents across the corpus which contain all the query terms. These documents are given priorities while ranking over the ones which doesnot contain all the query terms. Boolean model plays an important role in determining the number of hits. So, the queries for which the number of hits are fairly high like Query2 and Query3, boolean model plays a major role in determining the final rankings of the documents. As my implementation is solely based on Vector Space Model, there is only moderate overlap between the results for these two queries. On the other hand, for Query1 and Query4, the number of hits as per Lucene is less. Consequently, Boolean model plays a lesser signficant role in the final rankings leading to more overlap between the results generated by my implementation Of VSM and Lucene. 

Other minor deviations in the rankings generated by the two retrieval models may be accounted for the fact that Lucene internally uses certain boosting factors, coordination factors and normalizations in their scoring functions. As my code is just raw implementation of the Vector Space Model, there are minute variations in the final score of the documents as well as their corresponding rankings.
