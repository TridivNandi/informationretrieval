Simple Statistics of G1_Graph and G2_Graph::
--------------------------------------------

A. G1_Graph:

The total number of pages in the graph are : 1000
The total number of pages in the graph with no out-links (sinks) are : 10
The total number of pages in the graph with no in-links (sources) are : 0

Proportion of pages with no out-links (sinks) = (number of sink pages in the graph) / (total number of pages in the graph)
											  = 10 / 1000 = 0.01
											  
Proportion of pages with no in-links (sources) = (number of source pages in the graph) / (total number of pages in the graph)
											  = 0 / 1000 = 0
											  
A. G2_Graph:

The total number of pages in the graph are : 183811
The total number of pages in the graph with no out-links (sinks) are : 66175
The total number of pages in the graph with no in-links (sources) are : 14350

Proportion of pages with no out-links (sinks) = (number of sink pages in the graph) / (total number of pages in the graph)
											  =  66175 / 183811 = 0.3600165387272797
											  
Proportion of pages with no in-links (sources) = (number of source pages in the graph) / (total number of pages in the graph)
											  =  14350 / 183811 = 0.0780693212049333
